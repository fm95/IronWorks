Software engineer project, in collaboration with Zucchetti, an italian software house, developed during my last year of my  bachelor degree about an UML diagram generator (drag and drop by the user) of robustness diagram with automatic generation of the java code and sql file: you can draw User (Actor), Boundary, Controller and Entity, the persistent object of the diagram, on which the code is generated.
 --> The goal was to create a tool to improve the software development process by creating a tool that was like a user-friendly connection between the generation phase to the code generation in the end.
